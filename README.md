## Guiding Principals

 - Focus on understanding
 - From OpenAI:
   > Write your own implementations. You should implement as many of the [algorithms] from scratch as you can, with the aim of writing the shortest correct implementation of each. This is by far the best way to develop an understanding of how they work, as well as intuitions for their specific performance characteristics.
  - Implemenations live in this repo
  - In absence of a specific (project need) learning goal, the goal is build the knowledge required to build AGI

## High-Level Plan

 1. Mathematical Background
 2. Machine Learning in General
 3. Deep Learning
 4. Reinforcement Learning

 - Specific programming skills / tools at any time as needed
 - Future ideas for areas of study:
