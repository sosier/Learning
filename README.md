_Note: This repo contains the preparatory learning I did to be as prepared as possible for my Master's in Computer Science (specialzing in Machine Learning). As I'm in my Master's program now, I'm no longer actively working through this content._

# Learning Plan

## Guiding Principals

 - Focus on understanding
 - From OpenAI:
   > Write your own implementations. You should implement as many of the [algorithms] from scratch as you can, with the aim of writing the shortest correct implementation of each. This is by far the best way to develop an understanding of how they work, as well as intuitions for their specific performance characteristics.
  - Implemenations live in this repo

## High-Level Plan

 1. Mathematical Foundations
 2. Machine Learning in General
 3. Deep Learning
 4. Reinforcement Learning

 - Specific programming skills / tools at any time as needed
 - Future ideas for areas of study:
